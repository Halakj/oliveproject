# oliveproject

An intelligent system for olive land leasing and Prunning olive tree branch.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
## About the Project
This graduation project connects land owners with farmers through a mobile application.  
It also integrates a smart hardware system for analyzing olive branches using image processing and machine learning.


### Main Features
- Landowners can post their olive lands for leasing.
- Farmers can browse, request, and manage land leases.
- Real-time notifications and communication between landowners and farmers.
- Smart pruning system:
  - Raspberry Pi + Pi Camera captures olive branch images.
  - CNN model analyzes the image.
  - App shows pruning recommendations (whether pruning is needed or not).

##  Tech Stack
- Flutter (Dart) for mobile application.
- Firebase for authentication, database, and notifications.
- Raspberry Pi 4 with Pi Camera for hardware integration.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for olive pruning analysis.
